CSS Challenge

This exercise requires building four UI elements: a set of buttons, a toggle switch, a text input, and some interactive text.

See the screenshot for a sense of the visual design and interactions.

The general guidelines for the creation and submission of your work are as follows:

- Spend no more than 30 minutes on each element.
- Do your best to match the visual specifications from the videos. Color palette and font details are provided.
- Do not modify the HTML provided in the CodePen.
- No JS
- You may use the CSS Preprocessor of your choice

This assessment is not a definitive evaluation of how awesome you are as a developer, but it will help us better understand how you evaluate a design specifications, work through problems, and put elements together.
